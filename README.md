Final Project for Econ 554: Urban Economics

## Setup

### Data Download
Most of the data needed for reproduction is packaged in the `/data` directory. The one exception is the ~8GB tract distance file, which can be downloaded from the NBER [here](https://www.nber.org/research/data/tract-distance-database). Note that the file used is the 100-mile data for 2010.
